✅ Log in or Create Your NordPass Account
___________________
If you already have a NordPass account, simply log in using your credentials. If not, click “Create Account” and register using your email and a master password. Your master password is the only one you’ll ever need to remember—make it strong!

✅ Set Up Biometric Access or Unlock Method

On supported devices, you’ll have the option to set up biometric authentication like Face ID or fingerprint scanning. This makes future logins even faster and more secure.

✅ Start Importing or Saving Passwords

Protect your account with MFA using an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy. It’s an essential layer of security that prevents unauthorized access even if your master password is compromised.
